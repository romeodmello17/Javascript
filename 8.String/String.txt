We can defince String in four ways:
    1. Single quotes
        eg. let a = 'Amruta'
    2. Double quotes
        eg. let b = "Amruta"
    3. Backticks
        eg. let c = `Amruta`
    4. Constructor
        eg. let strObj = new String("Sharvari");
            console.log(strObj);
    
Template literals aka Backticks:
    - It is used to write multi line String
    - It will allow interpolation by using syntax ${ }

Interpolation:
    - It means we can access variables , we can perform operations along with Strings.

AutoBoxing:
    - Primitive String not having any methods.
    - When we try to  use methods in String, that String temporarily convert to String object.
    - And it will inherit properties from its prototye.

String property:
    - length.
        - It will return length of the String.

String methods:
    1. .toUpperCase():
        - It will convert the String into Upper Case.
    2. .toLowerCase():
        - It will convert the String into Lower Case.
    3. .trim():
        - It will remove the empty spaces from the beginning and the end of the String not in between String.
    4. .replace(arg1 , arg2):
        - It will change first satisfied String.
    5. .replaceAll(arg1 , arg2):
        - It will replace all satisfied Strings.

Searching methods:
    1. .indexOf(arg1 , StartingIndex ,Optional):
        - It will return the index of the given value.
        - By default StartingIndex is 0.
        - It wil Search in increasing order.
    2. .lastIndexOf(arg1,StartingIndex,Optional):
        - It will return the index of the given value.
        - By default StartingIndex is last index number.
        - It will start search in decreasing order.
    3. .include():
        - It will check wether given value is present in the String or not, and return boolean value for that.
    4. .startsWith("i am"):
        -
    5. .endsWith("g"):
        -
