How many ways we can declare a number?
    -Two ways :
        1. Literal way 
            eg. let a = 50;
        2. Number constructor
            eg. let b = new Number(100);

AutoBoxing:
    - Generally primitive numbers are not having any methods.
    - When we try to use any methods on primitive numbers, it will automatically convert to temporarily Number Object
    - It will inherit properties from its prototye.

Number Constructor Methods:
    1. valueOf():
        - it will return value of the number.
    2. toString():
        - it will convert the number to String.
    3. toFixed():
        - to Fix the number after decimal point.
    4. toPrecision():
        - to precise the whole number.
    5. toExponential():
        - it will convert number in power values
