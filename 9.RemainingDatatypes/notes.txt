Seperating Characters and Strings method:
    1. charAt(index):
        - It is used to get single Character from the String.
    2. substring(startingIndex,endingIndex):
        - It is used to get multiple Characters from the String.
        - It will not accept negative index.
        - Order of index numbers does'nt matter.
    3. slice(startingIndex,endingIndex):
        - It is used to get multiple Characters from th String.
        - It will accept negative index.
        - Order of index numbers matters here.

String to Array:
    1. split(spliting_Character):
        - 
    2. boolean:
        - Two ways we can declare boolean:
            1. literal way: let g = true;
            2. boolean function: let f = Boolean(123);
        
Falsy values :
    1. false
    2. 0
    3. ""
    4. undefined
    5. null
    6. NaN

Difference :

undefined :
    1. If the declaration is done , initialization is not done means undefined.
    2. typeOf undefined is undefined.


null : 
    1. Intentional absence is known as null.
    2. typeOf null is Object. In javaScript null is representing absence of Object.

    
    3. BigInt:
        - It is used for orbitary precision. That means handling larger number with accuracy. handling larger number with more precision.
        Two ways we can declare BigInt:
            - literal way with suffix as (n) : let g = 12345n;
            - function way with function BigInt(n); : let g = BigInt(2344576);

    4. symbol:
        - It is unique and immutable value used as key in Object.
